# scratch_clone

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## todo list
1. add more data to the blockmodel like parent block , child block and the code that the block should carry and different block types
2. more block types ({input,input},{input,output},{output,input},{output,output})
3. add state management to reference the block being dragged since there is no way of accessing the block being dragged to add the snapping feature
4. add snapping feature by offsetting the dragged block below the target block when contact happens or distance between them is less than some threshold
5. add the upperblock as a parent to the lower block and the lower block as a child to the upper block (sort of like a tree or double linked list)
6. iterete over the connected blocks via recurion or while loop and concatenate the code of each block to global empty string
7. execute the code using the darteval function in run time
8. add a canvas page to draw different shapes and freehand
9. add animation sequence for each sketch(drawing layer)
